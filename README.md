Algorithm Analysis
For algorithm 1, it is suppose to cause deadlock. For some reason, on our computers, it won't produce Deadlock. To prevent starvation, algorithm 3 is the best option.


Carter Lange and Will Copley
- Both of us met up in office hours to work on this, so we worked on this an equal amount. We worked on the 3 algorithms and the Barber shop together in office hours
